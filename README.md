Formal definition

A zero-day is a vulnerability that is:

Unknown to the public (or not yet formally cataloged)

Has no CVE assigned yet

May already be exploited or considered dangerous

“Zero-day” means defenders have had zero days to prepare.
What this means in real life

Security teams cannot wait for CVE feeds

Traditional vulnerability scanners won’t catch it yet

Action must be taken based on:

Threat intelligence

Vendor advisories

Internal research

Suspicious behavior

✅ This is exactly where SBOMs + policy enforcement shine.
